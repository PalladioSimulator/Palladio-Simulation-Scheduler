# Palladio-Supporting-Scheduler
Implementation of resource scheduler logic for simulation-based PCM analyzers. This is an implementation of the base classes used by the exact scheduler researched by Jens Happe in his PhD thesis. This part only implements basic scheduler support. Schedulers for exact operating system schedulers can be found in the PCM Exact Schedulers Addon.
